# Terraform Challenge

In the previous exercise, you learned how to configure the Terraform scripts to build the basic infrastructure resources by using the modular block. Also, the network is established using the VPC Peering connection between the VPCs to facilitate communication between the production workloads and the outside world. For the following exercise, try to configure the Terraform scripts to achieve the below requirements.

**Instead of using the VPC Peering connection to connect different VPCs, please modify the scripts to use the Enterprise Router to facilitate such communication. By using the same architecture diagram as in [Figure 3.0](https://github.com/hwcloud-apac-pso/terraform-101-workshop/blob/main/workshop/02_Solution_Overview.md), replace the VPC Peering connection with the Enterprise Router. Throughout the exercise, you will encounter some limitations and require to perform the manual configuration. Try to figure out what are those limitations.**
